            <li>Dance can change your life, because you will feel differently when you do it. You may find
        self-acceptance and not worry so much about how others see you. Others may in fact feel envious
        that you are so free and able to have this outlet. It’s a blessing to be able to move and glide
        across a floor.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <li>Dance has many ways for you to get involved through your school, local studio’s, and arts through
            administration or internships. Adult classes exist at almost every dance studio for the beginner
            to advanced levels for who are interested in studying dance. </li>
