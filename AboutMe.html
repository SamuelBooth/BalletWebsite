                    My experience with dance first started in my youth when my family and I dropped off my cousin at
            a dance class. Unfortunately, this had little impression on me. Fast forward to high school I was
            asked to participate in my townâ€™s local studio for a spring show. After accepting this spontaneous
            experience, I found a passion for movement and switched to full time Ballet Classes. After graduating
            Highschool and then attending a 6-week summer intensive in Orlando on scholarship. I accepted a full
            training position at BalletMet In Columbus, Ohio. After a wonderful year and more than 30 Professional
            shows completed with the BalletMet. I transferred to a small Ballet company in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
            Their I played Core de Ballet, Soloist and Lead roles including Lead Phantom, from Phantom of the Opera
            and Arabian Coffee Soloist, from The Nutcracker. 4 years later of being a Professional Ballet Dancer I
            was equipped with a wealth of life changing experiences. I can honestly say Ballet saved my mind, body
            and spirit. Movement through space is a gift from God. I hope you can find yourself through any form of
            dance too.
