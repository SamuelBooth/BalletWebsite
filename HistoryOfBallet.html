            <br>
            <dd>This dance form originally started in Italy. It was then a form of court pageantry, which was part
                of lavish celebrations in the area of the Italian Renaissance sometime in the 15th century.
                Soon After it flourished in Russia and France, where the dance was made into the form of concert dance.
                Dancers and musicians worked with one another to give the audience elaborate entertainment. Thanks to
                the French ballet de courts, this art form got another major boost. During this time, several noteworthy
                aspects such as costumer, décor and music were combined with social dances. Its biggest boost came in
                the 17th century. At that time, it became part of the French court, which happened during the reign of
                Louis XIV. By 1850, this interesting dance form has already reached countries like Russia and Denmark.
                Similarly, the attractiveness of this dance form made its approach to the United States.</dd>

            <dt><strong>How is Ballet Driven Culture?</strong></dt>
            <br>
            <dd>Today we find Modern Dance created through the A, B, C’s (Ballet) of dance. Though it clearly is not
                ballet by any traditional definition, it often incorporates balletic movement. Although though it may
                also incorporate additional dance elements such as folk dancing or ethnic, religious, or social dancing.
                It may also take just one simple aspect of movement. As modern dance evolves in the styles and methods
                of new generations of choreographers. The term modern dance can mean something brand new. </dd>
